# Layout and pagination parity with Microsoft Word

> **Last reviewed:** 2026-10-11 · **Last updated:** 2026-10-11 · **Change:** minor (list-label line height measured and corrected; other checklist rows retain their previous assessment) · **Target:** Microsoft Word (Microsoft 365) for Mac 16.113.4

A document only "opens correctly" if its pages break where Word breaks them: the same lines, the
same page count, footnotes and pictures on the same pages. This checklist covers line breaking,
pagination and object placement in `crates/layout`. Typing behaviour is in
[`typing-parity.md`](typing-parity.md); the reading and writing of the properties is in
[`file-format-parity.md`](file-format-parity.md).

**Dimension: ~55% (estimated), 90–145 h to full** (the sum of the rows below). The engine implements most of Word's layout
rules, but nothing has been compared page-for-page with Word on real documents, and the default
font can't match Word's metrics.

## Checklist

✅ matches Word as far as our tests show · 🟡 implemented, differs or untested against Word · ❌ missing

| Feature | State | Evidence / gap | Hours |
|---|---|---|---|
| Line breaking (UAX #14 with Word's exceptions: no break after `/`) | ✅ | `layout::tests::no_line_break_right_after_a_slash` | — |
| Justification, Word 2013+ space shrinking (compat mode 15) | ✅ | #109 | — |
| Kashida justification (Arabic) | ❌ | no kashida in `crates/layout` | 3–5 |
| Distributed / Thai distributed alignment | 🟡 | read; layout untested | 1–2 |
| Default font metrics (Aptos, Calibri, Cambria…) | 🟡 | Carlito/Caladea/Liberation are metric-compatible for Calibri/Cambria/Arial/Times/Courier; **Aptos (Word's default since 2024) has no metric-compatible open substitute**, so new Word documents wrap differently ([typing-parity.md](typing-parity.md) Known gaps). Needs an owner decision (commission or license a metric-matched font) | 6–10 + owner |
| Line spacing (single, 1.5, double, at least, exactly, multiple), spacing before/after, contextual spacing | 🟡 | List-label ascent overflow is unscaled by multiple spacing and uses the text descent for automatic/AtLeast spacing (synthetic Word probes below). Baseline leading and paragraph-gap overlap remain separate (#135, #108 open) | 3–5 |
| Widow/orphan control, keep with next, keep lines together, page break before | ✅ | `lib.rs` keep_next/keep_lines | — |
| Tabs (left, center, right, decimal, bar), leaders | 🟡 | Bar tabs untested | 1–2 |
| Hyphenation (automatic, 0.25" zone, soft hyphens, consecutive limit) | 🟡 | English patterns only; other languages hyphenate wrongly or not at all | in localization |
| Drop caps | ✅ | 2026-10-06 | — |
| Columns, column breaks, separators | 🟡 | **Columns don't balance** at a continuous section break or document end | 4–6 |
| Section breaks (next page, continuous, even, odd), different first page, odd/even headers | ✅ | Section breaks don't show in Draft view (#42) | 1–2 |
| Body top below a tall header, footer pushes body up | ✅ | #138 | — |
| Footnotes at the page bottom, endnotes at the end, note numbering | 🟡 | A long note continues onto the next page at a line boundary (its first line stays with the reference), first in that page's note area under a full-width continuation separator (#352); the document's own `w:continuationSeparator`/`w:continuationNotice` aren't read (default line, no notice); per-section restart partial | 2–4 |
| Tables: row heights (at least/exact), rows split across pages, header rows repeat, Can't Split | ✅ | 2026-10-06, #138 | — |
| Tables: autofit to contents/window, fixed widths, Word 2013 edge | 🟡 | #137; #44: AutoFit Contents measures each column's narrowest and widest text and shares the width like Word, once (not live as you type); cell preferred widths and spans still differ | 3–5 |
| Floating tables (`w:tblpPr`) | 🟡 | #137; overlap rules untested | 2–3 |
| Nested tables | 🟡 | render; polish missing | 2–4 |
| Floating pictures/shapes placement (relative to page/margin/column/paragraph/line/character) | ✅ | #136 | — |
| Text wrap: square, top-and-bottom, behind, in front | ✅ | 2026-10-06 | — |
| Text wrap: tight, through (contour, wrap polygon) | ❌ | laid out as square | 6–10 |
| Text boxes, overflow, linked text boxes | 🟡 | #46; linked text boxes missing | 3–5 |
| Rotated objects and text | 🟡 | #332: pictures, shapes, charts and groups drawn turned and flipped about their centre (screen and PDF); square wrap and inline lines keep clear of the rotated bounds; hit testing on the turned shape. Text in a rotated text box stays upright | 2–3 |
| Page borders (from page edge or text), page colour, watermark | ✅ | | — |
| Line numbers (restart per page/section, count by) | ✅ | | — |
| Vertical page alignment | ✅ | | — |
| Gutter, mirror margins, book fold, 2 pages per sheet | 🟡 | gutter and mirror margins; book fold missing | 2–3 |
| Document grid (`w:docGrid`, lines per page, characters per line) | ❌ | East Asian documents paginate differently without it | 4–6 |
| Vertical text (`tbRl`) in sections and text boxes; cell text direction | 🟡 | cell text direction landed (#245); page-level and text-box vertical text missing | 8–12 |
| Ruby / phonetic guide, enclose characters, combined characters | ❌ | | 4–6 |
| Bidirectional paragraphs, mixed-direction lines | 🟡 | #207; RTL sections and tables (`w:bidiVisual`) missing | 4–6 |
| Equations: display layout, numbering, wrapping long display equations | ✅ | #191; long display equations break at top-level operators (`m:brkBin`, `m:brkBinSub`), manual breaks and `m:alnAt`, continuation lines indented by `m:wrapIndent` or set right (`m:wrapRight`) (#326) | — |
| Hidden text excluded from breaking and hyphenation | ✅ | #173 | — |
| Fields: PAGE, NUMPAGES, SECTIONPAGES, TOC page numbers | ✅ | #52 | — |
| Compatibility modes (Word 2003/2007/2010 layout for old files: `w:compat` options) | 🟡 | mode 15 behaviour; the ~60 legacy compat options are mostly ignored | 10–20 |
| Page-by-page comparison harness against Word | ❌ | Run Word locally on our own synthetic documents, export PDF, compare line breaks; Word output stays under `plan/` (never committed) | 8–12 |

## List-label line spacing

Controlled original DOCX probes against Word for Mac 16.113.3 (26092714), macOS 26.6.2,
compatibility mode 15, zero paragraph gaps, Roboto Regular 12 pt body text: a label's positive
ascent overflow adds to the text line pitch without being multiplied by automatic spacing.
Label descent does not enlarge automatic or AtLeast spacing. A label's ascent includes positive
hhea leading; Apple Symbols distinguishes this from the text metric's half-gap split. These are
observations of synthetic documents, not a claim about Word's internal implementation.

| Label / spacing | Word baseline gap | Fixed WordCraft | Before fix |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Roboto 24 pt / single | 25.20 pt | 25.1953 pt | 28.125 pt |
| Roboto 24 pt / 1.25 | 28.80 pt | 28.7109 pt | 35.1563 pt |
| Roboto 24 pt / double | 39.36 pt | 39.2578 pt | 56.25 pt |
| Apple Symbols 12 pt / AtLeast 12 pt | 13.92 pt | 14.0625 pt | 14.6338 pt |
| Apple Symbols 24 pt / AtLeast 12 pt | 20.88 pt | 20.9297 pt | 24.0 pt |

Actual font metrics and original-input provenance were checked locally; Word-derived exports
remain uncommitted. Tolerance is 0.25 pt; this evidence covers Latin text with the tested symbol
and decimal labels, automatic single/1.25/double spacing, AtLeast controls, Exactly 24 pt,
wrapped paragraphs and save/reopen. Regression tests inject the independently measured metrics
so CI does not require those installed fonts. Inline pictures retain their existing height floor.
Picture bullets are not implemented, and the private Linux Symbol substitution report has not
been reproduced. Absolute baseline-leading placement remains the separate #108 contribution.
This narrows gap #4 without raising the overall readiness estimate.
